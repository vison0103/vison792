# vison792
This repository is used to store code for the 792 project.
This model is based on the changes and enhancements to MobileViT proposed by the Apple team.
MobileViT papers can be found at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02178.pdf
The original version of MobileViT referenced code from the team of authors of the paper. Here are the links:
https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets/blob/main/cvnets/models/classification/mobilevit.py

The four files in the code directory are described as follows:
AblationStudy.ipynb:This file contains the relevant code for the ablation experiment.
EMViT.ipynb:In this document is our enhanced MobileViT model based on MobileViT improvements. Please refer to the paper for specific improvement.
T-test.ipynb:This file contains code related to T-test.
EMViT&MViT.ipynb:This file contains some variants of the model design process, as well as the original version of the model and the enhanced model. Mainly used for comparative experiments.

The code is written in colab and can be run directly in colab.

The model was validated using the following three publicly available datasets. You can find the corresponding data set by following the link below.
